AMSC663: Inverse Optimization Methods

This project implements state-of-the-art inverse optimization
(IO) methods found in the literature.  Currently, we are focusing
on Chan et al.'s 2018 paper on generalized inverse optimization.

The gio.py file contains the GIO class which allows users
to create a GIO object that will hold data and perform
IO functionality found in the paper.  

testing_gio.py includes unit tests for the GIO models.

testing_rho_p.py is a script under development to test the
goodness-of-fit metric methods.  Producing rho values is
the ``in progress'' part of the project at the moment.
